\begin{abstract}
  Much of calculus can be explored via conceptual questions.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

We are considering using some of these questions to monitor how our
calculus courses are going, but to do this, \textbf{we need your
  help.}  Many of your fellow stuents have answered many of the
questions below; can you try to answer some of them?  Your help us
choose the best questions.
